# Gromegle
Gromegle is a WebRTC based mesh network video chat application that runs on most internet browsers. A signalling service called Scaledrone is used to let users setup connections and communicate via a text chat.

### Scaledrone
Scaledrone has a limited amount of connections and an attached API key, so testing should take place on a new test account. \
Line 4 in scripts.js has the Scaledrone API key, which should be replaced by a new one.
